# Spotify Downloader Installer Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for the Spotify Downloader application installer workflow and user experience. The installer is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and provide a consistent experience across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Minimize required user decisions and input
2. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Maintain a similar experience across platforms
3. **Clarity**: Provide clear information at each step
4. **Efficiency**: Complete installation quickly with minimal user intervention
5. **Security**: Adhere to platform security best practices
6. **Accessibility**: Support all users regardless of ability

## Installer Workflow

### Common Flow Across All Platforms

1. **Welcome Screen**
   - Application logo/branding
   - Version information
   - Brief description
   - Legal notice and license agreement link

2. **License Agreement**
   - Display MIT license text
   - Require acceptance to continue

3. **Installation Options**
   - Installation location selector
   - Component selection (core, GUI, command-line tools, documentation)
   - Create desktop shortcut option
   - Add to Start Menu/Applications folder option
   - Associate file extensions option

4. **Installation Progress**
   - Progress bar with percentage
   - Current operation description
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Option to show detailed log

5. **Completion**
   - Installation success message
   - Launch application option
   - View documentation option
   - Open GitHub page option

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### Windows (MSI Installer)

- UAC prompt for admin privileges
- Windows Start Menu folder selection
- File association for .spotifylist files
- Add to PATH option
- Registry entries for uninstaller

#### macOS (DMG with Application Bundle)

- Drag-and-drop installation to Applications folder
- App notarization and Gatekeeper compatibility
- Permissions request dialogs
- Launch Services registration for file types

#### Linux (Debian/RPM/AppImage)

- Package dependencies resolution
- Different installation flows for different package formats
- Desktop entry creation
- MIME type registration

## User Experience Design

### Visual Design

- Match application's visual identity
- Use platform-native UI elements where possible
- Dark/Light mode support where applicable
- Consistent logo and branding

### Interaction Design

- Responsive buttons and controls
- Clear next/back navigation
- Keyboard navigation support
- Error handling with clear recovery options

### Accessibility Considerations

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard shortcuts for all actions
- High contrast mode support
- Font size adjustability

## Silent Installation

For automated deployments, the installer will support silent installation mode with the following capabilities:

### Windows

```
SpotifyDownloader-Setup.exe /S /D=C:\CustomPath
```

### macOS

```
installer -pkg SpotifyDownloader.pkg -target / -dumplog /tmp/install.log
```

### Linux

```
sudo apt install -y ./spotify-downloader.deb  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo rpm -i spotify-downloader.rpm            # RHEL/Fedora
```

## Uninstallation

The installation will include proper uninstallation capability:

1. **Windows**: Add entry to Add/Remove Programs with uninstaller
2. **macOS**: Standard application removal support
3. **Linux**: Package manager uninstallation support

The uninstaller will:
- Remove all application files
- Remove application shortcuts
- Preserve user data and configuration by default
- Offer option to remove all application data

## Verification Process

The installer will verify:
- Sufficient disk space
- Required system capabilities
- Necessary permissions
- Digital signature integrity
- Dependency availability

## Upgrade Process

When upgrading from a previous version:
- Preserve user settings and data
- Inform user about what's new
- Allow selective component upgrades
- Offer backup creation of critical data

## Implementation Technologies

- **Windows**: Inno Setup or WiX Toolset
- **macOS**: pkgbuild and productbuild
- **Linux**: FPM (Effing Package Management)
- **Cross-platform Framework**: PyInstaller for executable generation

## Testing Requirements

The installer must be tested on:
- All supported operating systems
- Various permissions scenarios
- With and without previous versions installed
- Network and non-network installation scenarios
- Silent and interactive modes
