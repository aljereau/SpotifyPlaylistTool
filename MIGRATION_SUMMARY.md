# PyQt6 to PySide6 Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of the Spotify Downloader application from PyQt6 to PySide6. The migration was necessary to ensure compatibility with Python 3.13, as PyQt6 had issues running on this newer Python version.

## Key Changes

1. **Framework Replacement**: Replaced PyQt6 with PySide6 throughout the codebase
2. **Import Paths**: Updated all imports to use PySide6 modules
3. **QAction Location**: Moved QAction imports from QtWidgets to QtGui
4. **Property Handling**: Replaced pyqtProperty with Property
5. **QVariant Usage**: Removed QVariant references, using Python values directly instead
6. **Signal/Slot Naming**: Renamed pyqtSignal to Signal and pyqtSlot to Slot
7. **Exec Method**: Changed .exec() to .exec_() for dialog and application execution
8. **Mouse Event Handling**: Updated mouse position access with .position() methods
9. **High DPI Settings**: Removed high DPI application attributes which are now on by default
10. **Dependencies**: Updated requirements.txt and ui_requirements.txt to use PySide6

## Compatibility Fixes

1. **Removed QVariant**: In PySide6, QVariant is no longer needed as Python values are used directly
2. **Mouse Event Position**: .pos(), .x(), .y() methods were replaced with .position() equivalents
3. **Application Execution**: Changed exec() to exec_() for backward compatibility
4. **Property Declaration**: Changed decorators from pyqtProperty to Property
5. **State Flag Access**: Updated references to QStyle.State to use QStyle.StateFlag

## New Features

1. **Install Script**: Created an install_dependencies.bat script to simplify setup
2. **User Documentation**: Updated the README-HOWTO.md with clear PySide6 instructions
3. **Batch Scripts**: Enhanced the batch scripts to automatically set up FFmpeg
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages when dependencies are missing

## Benefits of Using PySide6

1. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Works with the latest Python version
2. **LGPL Licensing**: More permissive license compared to PyQt6's GPL
3. **Qt Company Support**: Official support from Qt Company maintainers
4. **Features**: Access to newer Qt features and improvements
5. **Optional Pythonic APIs**: Access to snake_case methods and true_property features (though not used in this migration)

## Testing

The application was tested on Windows with Python 3.13.1 and PySide6 6.9.0, confirming that:
- Command-line interface works correctly
- GUI launches properly
- FFmpeg integration functions as expected
- All components display and function as intended

## Future Considerations

1. **Clean Up**: Consider further cleaning up the codebase to take advantage of PySide6-specific features
2. **Snake Case**: Optionally convert method calls to snake_case for more Pythonic code
3. **True Properties**: Consider using the true_property feature for cleaner property access
4. **Packaging**: Test with various packaging tools for distribution

## Conclusion

The migration from PyQt6 to PySide6 was successful, ensuring that the Spotify Downloader application remains usable on modern Python versions. The application retains all of its functionality while gaining improved compatibility and future support.
