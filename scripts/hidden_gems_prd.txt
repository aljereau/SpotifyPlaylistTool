# Spotify Hidden Gems Finder PRD

## Project Overview
An enhancement to the Spotify Playlist Link Extractor that focuses on discovering high-quality underground music tracks. The tool analyzes multiple playlists to identify and score "hidden gems" - tracks with low popularity but high potential, based on various metrics and patterns.

## Core Features

1. Hidden Gems Scoring System
   - Analyze tracks based on popularity scores (0-100)
   - Focus on tracks in lower popularity range (0-30)
   - Implement weighted scoring based on:
     * Playlist context quality
     * Artist metrics
     * Market presence patterns
     * Temporal analysis

2. Multi-Playlist Analysis
   - Process multiple playlists simultaneously
   - Cross-reference tracks across playlists
   - Aggregate and normalize data
   - Pattern recognition across contexts

3. Automated Playlist Generation
   - Create curated playlists of hidden gems
   - Enable Spotify recommendations for similar tracks
   - Facilitate rapid discovery process
