# Spotify Downloader UI - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Spotify Downloader UI is a graphical user interface for the existing Spotify Playlist Extractor tool. It will provide an intuitive and user-friendly way for users to extract and analyze track information from Spotify playlists, with a focus on discovering "hidden gems" - tracks with high potential but low popularity.

## Objectives
1. Create a modern, intuitive UI for the existing command-line tool
2. Maintain all functionality of the current Spotify Playlist Extractor
3. Add visual representations of data analysis
4. Improve user experience for non-technical users
5. Support all existing features in a graphical interface

## User Personas
1. **Casual Music Fan**: Wants to discover new music and share playlists easily
2. **Music Curator**: Needs to analyze playlists deeply and create new collections
3. **Content Creator**: Uses the tool to find unique tracks for videos/podcasts
4. **Data Analyst**: Interested in music trends and visualization of data

## Technical Requirements
1. Use PyQt6 for the GUI framework
2. Maintain separation between UI and backend logic
3. Ensure all existing functionality remains intact
4. Support cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux)
5. Follow modern GUI design principles
6. Implement responsive layouts for different screen sizes
7. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Setup

- Background processing capability

### 4. Results Display
- Tabular view of extracted tracks
- Sortable and filterable track lists
- Visualization of hidden gems scoring
- Export options (CSV, TXT, etc.)
- Direct links to Spotify content

### 5. Hidden Gems Analysis
- Visual representation of scoring system
- Interactive thresholds adjustment
- Comparative analysis between playlists
- Percentage visualizations for metrics
- Custom scoring adjustment

### 6. Playlist Creation

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The UI should not significantly impact processing speed
2. **Usability**: Intuitive enough for first-time users without documentation
3. **Reliability**: Graceful handling of API limits and network issues
4. **Compatibility**: Support for high-DPI displays and accessibility features
5. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages (future expansion)

## Development Phases
1. **Foundation**: Basic UI framework, authentication, and simple playlist processing
2. **Core Features**: Complete implementation of main functionality
3. **Advanced Analysis**: Enhanced visualizations and analytical tools
4. **User Experience**: Refinements based on feedback and usability testing
5. **Distribution**: Packaging for various platforms and installer creation

## Success Criteria
1. All existing command-line functionality is accessible through the UI
2. New users can complete basic tasks without reference to documentation
3. Processing large playlists remains efficient and provides appropriate feedback
4. Visual representations enhance understanding of the data
5. User feedback indicates preference for the UI over command-line version

## Constraints
1. Must maintain compatibility with existing codebase
2. Should not require additional API credentials or permissions
3. Must respect Spotify API usage limits and terms of service
4. Should minimize additional dependencies beyond PyQt
