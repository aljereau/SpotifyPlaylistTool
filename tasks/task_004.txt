# Task ID: 4
# Title: Market Presence Evaluation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement market presence analysis system
# Details:
Build system to analyze:
- Available markets data
- Market penetration patterns
- Regional popularity variations
- Market-specific scoring

# Test Strategy:
Test with tracks having different market distributions

# Implementation Plan (2024-06-09):
- Review requirements:
  - Analyze available markets data for each track
  - Identify market penetration patterns
  - Detect regional popularity variations
  - Calculate market-specific scoring
- Codebase Exploration:
  - `analyze_market_presence(sp, track_id)` fetches available markets, calculates total markets, market coverage, and primary market scores for a track.
  - `analyze_market_patterns(track_details)` aggregates market coverage and primary market counts across tracks.
  - These analyses are integrated into playlist and combined analytics via `process_playlist` and `generate_combined_analysis`.
  - Output files include market analysis results for each playlist.
- Verification Plan:
  - Confirm that all four requirements are met by the current implementation.
  - If any aspect is missing (e.g., more granular regional analysis or advanced scoring), plan and implement improvements.
  - Test with tracks having different market distributions as per the test strategy.
- Next Steps:
  - Review the output of the current market analysis for completeness.
  - If complete, mark Task 4 as done. If not, implement the missing features and document changes.
